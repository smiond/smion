# Profile Image Setup

To add your profile image to the CV:

1. Save your profile image as `profile.jpg` or `profile.png` in the `public` folder
2. The image will automatically be used in the CV component

The image should be:
- Square format (1:1 aspect ratio) for best results
- At least 300x300 pixels
- JPG or PNG format
- Optimized for web (compressed but good quality)

Once you place the image in the public folder, the CV will automatically display it instead of the current User icon placeholder.
